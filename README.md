### Create a Charge

To charge a credit card, you create a charge object. If your API key is in test mode, the supplied card wonâ€™t actually be charged, though everything else will occur as if in live mode.

**Payload**

Refer to [Magpie documentation](https://magpie.im/documentation/#operation/createCharge) for request body guidelines.

**Sample**

```js
const payload = {
  amount: 50000,
  currency: 'php',
  source: 'tok_MTQ1ODAyOczNDJkj',
  description: 'Pet food and other supplies',
  statement_descriptor: 'Pet Shop Inc',
  capture: true
}
const charge = await magpie.charges.create(payload);
```
